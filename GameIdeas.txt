You are stuck in a level resembling an episode of a TV show genre and you have to get out to make it to the end of the episode/level (this one is my favorite idea of the three)

You are a bounty hunter on a stranded ship trying to steal an alien's UFO

You are an artist trying to capture his paintings that came to life and are creating havoc in the city
