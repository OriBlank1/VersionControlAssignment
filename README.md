Version control is a system in which your work is uploaded to a cloud and it gets saved and protected. This is especially helpful in case anything bad happens to your computer.

GitHub is essentially your own personal cloud where you can safely store your work. Git is the system that allows you to transport your work to the cloud.

Git status: checks status of your file (duh)

Git add: you post your updated file to the cloud

Git commit -m: brief description of change

Git push: your work is officially on your github repository!
